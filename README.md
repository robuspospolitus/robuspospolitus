My name is Nadia.
My goal is to learn as much as I possibly can! At the moment I'm learning ReactJS. At the moment I try to work on my own projects to still grow as a programmer as a student. Once I master the front-end, I'm going to learn back-end to become fullstack developer in the future :))


Sad fun fact!
Sharks can't code :(( (and play resident evil)
